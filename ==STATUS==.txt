Made good progress in making basically a mirror file browser the mirrors the OS file system
instead of my previous silly idea which was building a full fledged file browser.

OR maybe I can spin off an independant sound / sample manager and have a way to easilly drag and drop
it into the main application window. 

Would be a good test of the UI system.


Also, I don't want to spend too much time working on the specific UI for the tracker, the goal here is a 
cutting edge extremely useful UI library / system, the tracker UI is just a sample project to test the UI. 

My blog posts will mostly focus on the UI library, but I do need a reasonable semblance of a working application
before I can do things like meaningfully profile, etc, and blog about it, even if the focus is on the underlying
UI library.

I should also start to think about a secondary application that I want to build that will force me to figure out how 
I will decouble the existing core UI layers.
