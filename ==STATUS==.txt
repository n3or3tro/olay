- Spent a bunch of timing fucking around with the file browser only to realise, 
  I don't really want a drag and drop file manager inside the app. It should only
  display folders that you choose to import. And you can drag a file into your project
  that's basically it. More of a file viewer than a file manager.

- So:
    - Now I need to make sure my file dialogue stuff can handle filtering out only directories
    from the native file explorer, importing it, getting the path of the chose directory(s) and 
    their child files.
    - Then basically just rendering that tree in our view.

My file browser will respect the heiarachy of the system, so if you import one folder, and then 
later import some upper level folder, it will automatically pull the original folder into the parent folder
so only folders in the same level of the file heiarchy will be shown.

OR maybe I can spin off an independant sound / sample manager and have a way to easilly drag and drop
it into the main application window. 

Would be a good test of the UI system.



Also, I don't want to spend too much time working on the specific UI for the tracker, the goal here is a 
cutting edge extremely useful UI library / system, the tracker UI is just a sample project to test the UI. 

My blog posts will mostly focus on the UI library, but I do need a reasonable semblance of a working application
before I can do things like meaningfully profile, etc, and blog about it, even if the focus is on the underlying
UI library.

I should also start to think about a secondary application that I want to build that will force me to figure out how 
I will decouble the existing core UI layers.
